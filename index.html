            <h2 class="title2">About me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Costa Rica, a tiny country in Central America between Nicaragua, North of Costa Rica and Panama, to the South. The Caribean Sea to the East and Pacific Ocean to the West.
            </p>
            <p>I decided to do something different that will allow me to work closely with two passions of mine, design and technology. I always enjoyed drawing and I was drawn to art itself as a youngling and then design came as a natural progression. Technology on the other hand is plain awesome! New ways of doing things, of making life easier for people with challenges in their daily living with clever ideas. So, in short, I want to create things to help people out.
            </p>
            <p>The words I live by are, “If you don’t have time to do it right, when do you expect to have time to do it again?”. Not sure who’s quote is that, but I can tell it’s not mine. Still, there’s a lot of wisdom to them, I really try to apply them and avoid rushing myself. I firmly believe that rushing yourself to finish last with a poorly done job is a true waste of time.

            <h2 class="title2">Cool things I like to show</h2>
            <p>The following is a list of a few things I like to show people because they are awesome. Sometimes you are unaware of things around you and perhaps, what you need is someone to show you a little bit, for you to wet your toes as they say and then, take off</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>AC/DC's song, Shoot to thrill</dt>
                <dd>Maybe you are not a rock fan, maybe you are, regardless of that, this is a great song anyone can enjoy. Released back on July 25 1980 and included in the Back in Black album. Later it was used as part of Ironman 2's soundtrack and still as fresh as when it was released.</dd>
